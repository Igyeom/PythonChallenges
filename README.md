# Python Challenges
The Python Challenges source files by Ian 10L. **1st place** in GamesMasters Leaderboards, over **13000 points** obtained so far.

## To-do:
- actually claim the bonus points from mr abela lol (AS48, AS50, AS51)

## How to run the programs
Some programs may not work on their own, due to reasons such as requiring input files. Therefore, it is **strongly recommended** that you clone the repository (download the entire repo as ZIP) before testing them out. You must have [Python 3](https://python.org/downloads) installed for most challenges, and because of f-strings, you likely need to have Python 3.6+ installed.

You may need to run some [Assembly](https://github.com/codeabbey/intel4004-emu) code and/or [C++](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/), in which case download the respective interpreters/compilers by clicking on the links. CodeAbbey's Intel 4004 emulator requires Python 2 to run as well.
